in valueIterationAgents.py wrote:

def runValueIteration(self)

def computeQValueFromValues(self, state, action)

def computeActionFromValues(self, state)

v2 (05/30/2023)

in analysis.py

change the noise in question2() to 0.01 so that the agent would cross the bridge in getBridgeGrid() (gridworld.py)
